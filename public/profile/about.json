    "about": "Hi, My name is Hamza.\n\nI’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Queens College, CUNY, where I’ve gained a strong foundation in computer hardware, operating systems, and software applications through my coursework and hands-on projects. My recent internship with the Post-Quantum Cryptography & AI Research Group gave me the chance to sharpen my troubleshooting and problem-solving skills — skills that are crucial when helping end-users resolve technical issues.\n\nI think what I'm most proud of though, is my Hackathon experience. I've participated in 4 hackathons now, and they have all in their own way been the best learnign experiences I've had in relation to problem-solving, team work, and developing ideas to turn into products.",
